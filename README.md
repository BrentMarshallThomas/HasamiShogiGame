Hasami Shogi Game
Play a game of Hasami Shogi, variant 1

Overview
Hasami Shogi is a game played on a board similar to chess or checkers. There are two players, where one
controls the Red pieces 'R', and the other the Black pieces 'B'. The point of the game is to capture all
or all but one of your opponents pieces.

Game Play
The game begins with the player controling the black pieces. On your turn you can move any one piece
veritcal or horizontal on the game board (similar to a rook in chess). You cannot move through other pieces.
Play passes back and forth until the game is over (when one player has 0 or 1 pieces left).

Capturing pieces
Similar to 'Go' you can capture one or more pieces by having one of your pieces on each side of an opponent's 
piece(s). You may also capture a corner piece by being on the space above or below it and the other on one side or the other (see the following diagram)

(Imagine this is the upper left corner)
B R _ _ _
R _ _ _ _

Red would capture black's piece.
